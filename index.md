# What is this?

I went to Japan. Silly stuff happened. I decided to make a comic. And then a website for that comic.

# Will there be more?

Probably not.

The comic currently stops at Nara, which also just about marks the point where I set off on my solo leg of the trip (give or take). So, a pretty natural ending point.

Which is not to say there was nothing worth drawing in that one week I spent roaming and seeking out beauty alone. One could say there was almost too much. And although I have drawn nothing explicitly about the period, the spirit of that one week permeates this whole artistic project.
